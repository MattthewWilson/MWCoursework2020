## Learning Journal - Matthew Wilson

#### Note on Formating

While this journal should have been written as the year progressed, and I had intended to do so, that did not end up happening. As will be explained in more detail below, the work on this module ended being delayed greatly and so I had nothing to write in this journal. As a result everything up until Janurary is written retroactively. I appologise for this, and would have prefered not to have left so much of the writting so late.

#### Start of Term to Winter Holiday

Throughout the whole of this period little to no progress was made one this module. This was not due to a lack of effort, but rather due to large amounts of my time being taken up elsewhere. Various health issues have plagued me, which slowed progress and took up time. And in particular the 3D game design project was a constant source of difficulties and delays. I spent much of the time that should have been for this module working on the 3D game project instead. Doing this meant that I had to rush a lot of the work for this module later on. In hindsight it would have likely been a better idea to have stuck to working on this module earlier and to have not left it so late. However it was hard to judge that at the time.

#### Winter Holiday

During the winter holiday I finally made the first tutorial. I decided it would be best to make it on code that would also be used within the game, and that could be combined for the second part of work. For this reason I decided to make the tutorials on the scripting required for a basic main menu system.

#### Tutorial 1

The tutorial was relatively easy to make. Most of the time making it was spent watching tutorials. The process I used was more or less to learn how to create the script through tutorials, then to create it, referencing the tutorials whenever I was uncertain about something. And finally to write it down as a tutorial, referencing back to both the work I had done and the tutorials to ensure everthing was correct. In retrospect this was slower than just making the tutorial at the same time as learning to make the script. However, I feel this slow process did at least have the benifit of helping to refinforcing what had been learned.

#### Janurary

Although I did all the scripting covered in the remaining tutorials over december, I was so focused on the 3D game project that I didn't get around to writing the tutorials. It was only during Janurary that the writing was done. Although I had to rush through it which likely harmed its quality, I was still able to get it all done in time. As mentioned before, it would in retrospect have been a better idea to get the work done earlier. However I still feel it turned out okay.
