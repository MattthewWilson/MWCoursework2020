## Tutorial 5 - Gameover Menu

In this tutorial the gameover will be trigged by the timer system from the previous tutorial, although other things could be used for the trigger.

Create a new empty object, call it "gameOver" and add it to the canvas. Add three buttons to it and lable them "Retry", "Main Menu" and "Exit". Create a new C# script and call it "gameOverScript". Add the script to the canvas. Inside this script first creat a new public GameObject and name it "gameOverUI". Save the script and then drag and drop gameOver into the game object slot that will have opened in the inspector. This will be necessary for enable and disabling the gameover UI.
